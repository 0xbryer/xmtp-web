### Minor Changes

- [#62](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-web/pull/62) [`edb0a4d`](https://github.com/xmtp/xmtp-web/commit/edb0a4df15019a3a8c7ccecd0be47f140563ba31) Thanks [@rygine](https://github.com/rygine)! - Refactor processing of remote attachment content types. This update removes eager loading of remote data in the message processor in favor of the new `useAttachment` hook. With the `useAttachment` hook, developers can now respond to loading and error states when fetching the remote data.
