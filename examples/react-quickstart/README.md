# React quickstart example app

A quickstart example app using [React](https://react.dev/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), and [RainbowKit](https://www.rainbowkit.com/).

### Limitations

This example app demonstrates features of the React SDK, but it isn't a complete solution. For example, the list of conversations doesn't update when new messages arrive in existing conversations.

## Developing

After installing the dependencies, run `yarn dev` to start developing.

## Useful commands

- `yarn build`: Builds the example app
- `yarn clean`: Removes `node_modules`, `dist`, and `.turbo` folders
- `yarn dev`: Launches the example app in development mode
- `yarn format`: Runs prettier format and write changes
- `yarn format:check`: Runs prettier format check
- `yarn lint`: Runs ESLint
- `yarn typecheck`: Runs `tsc`
