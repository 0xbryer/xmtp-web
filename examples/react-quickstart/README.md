# React quickstart example app

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project_Status-Developer_Preview-yellow)

This is a quickstart example app using [React](https://react.dev/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), and [RainbowKit](https://www.rainbowkit.com/).

This example app is in **Developer Preview** status and ready to serve as a reference for you to start building with.

However, we do not recommend using Developer Preview software in production apps.

### Limitations

This example app demonstrates features of the React SDK, but it isn't a complete solution. For example, the list of conversations doesn't update when new messages arrive in existing conversations.

## Developing

After installing the dependencies, run `yarn dev` to start developing.
